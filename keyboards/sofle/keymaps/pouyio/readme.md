# Custom keymap for Sofle Keyboard

**Removed top row**, resulting in 6x3+(4-3).

Adapted to my personal needs:
- Coding
- Easier transition from iso-es layout.
- Same shortcuts among mac/lin/win.

Feature changes:
- Modifiers only in left (CMD/Super, Alt/Opt, Ctrl)
- Added more macros for both Mac and Linux/Win.
    - 
- The OLED has less info.
- Left encoder controls mute and next/prev track. Right encoder pause and .
- Layer tap in raise/lower buttons.
- Hold tap for `}`, `]` and `*`.
- Caps lock tapping both shifts.
